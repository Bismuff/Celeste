        </article>    
        <article class="oldsite gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p><br>This chapter has two main mechanics: The dream block, a solid block that you can dash through, and Badeline who will chase you from the second half of the chapter.

          <h2><br>Cassette Tape (B-Side)</h2>
          <p>The B-Side for this chapter can be found at the bottom of the climb after activating the dream blocks. Dash trough the bottom dream bloch to reach the secret room with the cassette tape!</p>

          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> At the end of the chapter, after leaving the dream, you might find a way to climb up to the top, where you will find a sing with a cryptic message...</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> When dashing through a screen transition, your dash gets refreshed. Use this mechanic to scale the first wall of the ruins, all the way to the crystal heart!</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="celestial story"><h2>Celestial Resort</h2>
          <p><br>Continuing the climb, Madeline finds herself in an old, decrepit hotel. After ringing the bell for service, a friendly (and insecure) ghost greets Madeline and introduces himself as Mr Oshiro. While following him though the hotel to your room, you help him organize the mess in the hotel, and encounter Theo again. Being creeped out by Mr Oshiro he breaks a vent and offers you to follow him in an escape from the hotel. Madeline refuses, recognizing that Oshiro needs help. <br><br> Arriving at the Suite, Badeline suddently breaks out of a mirror again and sours the mood with some quick and mean remarks about the hotel. Oshiro, of course, gets mad and asks Madeline to leave. Maybe it was smarter to sneak out with theo...</p>
        </article>    
        <article class="celestial gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p><br>The key for this chapter is timing. In this chapter you will find dust bunnies (or black goo), wich is deadly to the touch. While it often is stationary, the more dangerous version are the ones that move, giving you little time to think and keeping you on your toes! </p>
          <h2><br>Cassette Tape (B-Side)</h2>
          <p>After the clean-up, when getting the key, continue to the left to find the cassette tape!</p>
          <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
          <p>The crystal heart for this chapter is visible during the clean-up phase, in the book zone. Though the heart is visible, the passage to it is blocked by books.</p>
          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> I wonder if there is some secret way to get there after clearing them out?</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> After clearing the books, climb up the waterfall on the right side of the room. There you will find a hidden passage that takes you back through this part of the level, until you get to the crystal heart.</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="golden story"><h2>Golden Ridge</h2>
          <p><br>After the resort, the golden ridge offers a much more relaxing climb. Manouver though spiky crystals and moving blocks to climb up the wonderful landscape. <br><br> At the end of the chapter, you will find Theo waiting for you at an old Gondola-ride to further climb the mountain. <br><br> Unfortunately, it seems to stall mid-way, causing Madeline to get a panic attack. Whith the help of Theo and his grandpa's breathing technique, Madeline manages to calm down and as if by magic, the gondola takes them the rest of the way up!</p>
        </article>    
        <article class="golden gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p><br>Although Golden Ridge is one of the calmest story-wise, gameplay-wise it introduces a lot of new gimmicks! <br><br>Starting with the <b>blue bubbles</b>: Jump into one of them and hold a direction to get a slight dash in said direction, and refresh Madeline's dash! <br><br> Then there are the <b>clouds</b>: A bit different from trampolines, the clouds give you a great jump boost if you time your jumps right! The white clouds stay, but the pink clouds disappear after one bounce, so look out! <br><br>The <b>wind</b>: Wind blows in a direction, greatly speeding up or slowing down Madeline's movement in that direction. Use this to your advantage, saving your dash for the times you have to move against it! <br><br><b>Moving blocks</b>: Black directional blocks move in a direction as soon as Madeline touches them. Some (the ones with the buttons) Can be slightly manipulated to change their trajectory. <br><br> And lastly, <b>Snowballs</b>: Together with the wind, snowballs spawn at your current height in the level and travel at that level until they either hit you, killing you, or reaching the end of the screen. That is, unless you manage to jump on them! In that case, you get a small height boost and your dash is refreshed!</p>
          <h2><br>Cassette tape (B-Side)</h2>
          <p>In the screen with wind and three blue clouds, in the top left there is a secret passage. Get over there using the wind to your advantage and continue to the left until you get to the cassette room!</p>
          <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
          <p>The crystal heart of this chapter is found at the sanctuary. After reaching the glowing area, dive under the water to get to a secret room. Dash into the right wall to get into an even more secret room!</p>
          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> That block looks out of place! Its straight from SMB 3! Can i use it to climb up to the Heart?</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> In the game SMB 3, standing on the white block and holding crouch for a while makes you sink into the background. As a homage to SMB 3, if Madeline crouches for a while on the white block she goes into the background, and using the plattforms in the background you can easly climb up to the Crystal Heart!</span></p>
        </article>
        <article class="mirror story"><h2>Mirror Temple</h2>
          <p><br>Welcome to the most mysterious chapter in the whole game! Startion off directly after getting out of the gondola, Madeline is creeped out by this aincient temple. Theo, instead, finds it the perfect place to get some cool selfies and runs inside. <br> Follow him in to the temple and start exploring It's non-linear structure, while seraching for Theo, and soon you will find tha namesake Mirror. <br><br> Upon activating it (ignoring warnings by Badeline of the Mountains magic), Madeline seems to have awakened some monsters, as the temple changes around her reflecting her fears and morphing into creepy hallways, tentakle-like hazards and deadly crystal spikes. <br><br> Continue navigating through this maddening temple to find theo locked in a crystal, and carry him through rooms upon rooms of monsters trying to get you to finally reach the outside. Fortunately safe, but traumatized at the least!</p>
        </article>    
        <article class="mirror gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p><br>After the Golden Ridge, Mirror temple certainly does not slow down. The Mirror temple is home to multiple new gimmicks. <br><br>Starting off with <b>Door-Switches</b>: Green blinking Switches need to be dashed into to open various closed doors, and progress the level. <br><br> <b>Dash-Blocks</b>: These special blocks move suddently when Madeline dashes. Use your dash wiseley and use the momentum the block impart to fly with great speeds. <br><br> <b>Red Bubbles</b>: Unlike their blue counterparts, these red bubbles don't know when to stop. Get in one of them to fly in a direction, only stopping when hitting a wall, a hazard or dashing out to interrupt your flight. <br><br><b>Eye-Monsters</b>: These horrible creatures roam the level once the mirror has been activated. They dash towards Madeline on-sight, killing her on contact. Their dash can break red blocks, and they can not pass the white boundries. Like the snowballs and Mr Oshiro, you can jump on them to kill them and gain back your dash. Upon death, they become a statue for a brief moment until they respawn, giving off a shockwave movin Madeline and anything else closeby! <br><br><b>Crystal Theo</b>: Theo is stuck in a crystal, and its your job to carry him to safetey! Carry him with the climb-button, and let go to throw him in a direction! Theo can be used to interrupt the monsters dashes, and to press switches! </p>
          <h2><br>Cassette tape (B-Side)</h2>
          <p>Before activating the mirror, in the main big room, get to a strawberry. Then another one to the right, and to the right again enter a secret tunnel for an even more secret room. There you will find the cassette tape.</p>
          <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
          <p>The crystal heart of this chapter is found right before using the keys after the cassette.</p>
          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> One of the spiked plattforms is not like the others... what secrets does it hold?</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> using the red bubble to get back, interrupt your flight in the middle to find a secret red bubble going straight up. this will lead you to a secret tunnel letting you save the key and bypass the door. The key can later be used to open another door, one witch leads to the crystal heart.</span></p>

        <article class="reflection story"><h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p><br>This is the most story-heavy chapter, and the climax of Madeline's self-discovery. <br><br> After escaping the Mirror Temple, Theo and Madeline take settle down for the night and get to kno each other better. When their long conversation ends and they go to sleep Madeline wakes up in a dream, and decides to have a conversation with Badeline. <br><br> Unfortunateley, Madeline seems to have gotten the wrong idea about what Badeline is.

        </article>    
        <article class="reflection gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>

Still, a lot of new mechanics are intoduced. <br><br><b>Golden Feather</b>: The golden feather is an item that when collected turns Madeline into a golden sphere, flying with high speeds in whatever direction you are holding. The golden feathers can appear normally or in a bubble, in witch case you have to dash into them to activate them. <br><br><b>Kevin-blocks</b>: These funny-looking blocks stavel straight forward in a direction when they are dashed into. They are even strong enough to break some walls! <br><br><b>Bumpers</b>: These round elecric bumpers bounce you with great speeds in the opposite direction of the one you touch them in. They also refresh your dash!</p>

Dash downwards to break it out, and then use it to go straight up. From there use another feather to go back to the right and find the room with the crystal heart puzzle!</p>
          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> These colored crystals remind me of an earlier puzzle i solved! I wonther what these mirrored arrows mean?</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> Using the combination of dashes learnt in the CH1 Forsaken City Crystal heart room, dash in different directions corresponding to each torch: <br>Play (normal): Up, Left, Down-Right, Up-Right, Left, Up-Left <br>Horizontal mirror: Up, Right, Down-Left, Up-Left, Right, Up-Right <br>Vertical mirror: Down, Left Up-Right, Down-Right, Lrft, Down-Left <br> And Lastly, completeley mirrored: Down, Right, Up-Left, Down-Left, Right, Down-Right </span></p>

          <p><br>It's time to climb the mountain for real: Madeline teams up with her Reflection, and together they climb through a revised version of aall the previous chapters until they reach the summit. <br><br>The last climb is harsh and difficult, but now one, Madeline and her Reflection manage to overcome all odds and reach the top of Celeste Mountain, and in the process growing into a whole new person.</p>
        </article>

          <p><br><b>Hint:</b> There are <b>six</b> jewels, and <b>six</b> section to this level... That cant be a coincidence right?</p>
          <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> You need to fine each jewel in each section to unlock the crystal heart. The jewels can be found in these locations: <br><b>The star</b>: In the first section, dont grab the last purple orb and dash to the right wall instead. Go to the right to find this jewel. <br><b>Sapphire</b>: Take a roundabout route to the left and collect the strawberries until you find a small hole in the ground in the middle of a screen. Fall down and find the room with the sapphire. <br><b>Emerald</b>: While collecting strawberries again, you may find a section with two small dream blocks with spikes on top. The wall to the right between them is damaged, and dashing into it reveals the room with the emerald. <br><b>Topaz</b>: Before going up into the snowy area, you might find that the right wooden wall in the celestial resort is damaged. Go into it to find the secret room with the topaz. <br><b>Diamond</b>: One of the most difficult ones, at the beginning of the Golden Ridge section, go to the left room and double-dash up to the left to find a hidden ledge. From that one, continue heading left and up to find a secret room with strawberries and the diamond. <br><b>Pearl</b>: Go to the left at the beginning of this section to get to a secret strawberry room. There there is a red bubble, take it to the right. It will take you for a long ride until you reach a secret room with the pearl at the end.</span></p>

            <p><br>Continuing the climb, Madeline finds herself in an old, decrepit hotel. After ringing the bell for service, a friendly (and insecure) ghost greets Madeline and introduces himself as Mr Oshiro. While following him though the hotel to your room, you help him organize the mess in the hotel, and encounter Theo again. Being creeped out by Mr Oshiro he breaks a vent and offers you to follow him in an escape from the hotel. Madeline refuses, recognizing that Oshiro needs help. <br><br> Arriving at the Suite, Badeline suddently breaks out of a mirror again and sours the mood with some quick and mean remarks about the hotel. Oshiro, of course, gets mad and asks Madeline to leave. Maybe it was smarter to sneak out with theo...</p>

          <article class="Mcelestial gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
            <p><br>The key for this chapter is timing. In this chapter you will find dust bunnies (or black goo), wich is deadly to the touch. While it often is stationary, the more dangerous version are the ones that move, giving you little time to think and keeping you on your toes! </p>
            <h2><br>Cassette Tape (B-Side)</h2>
            <p>After the clean-up, when getting the key, continue to the left to find the cassette tape!</p>
            <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
            <p>The crystal heart for this chapter is visible during the clean-up phase, in the book zone. Though the heart is visible, the passage to it is blocked by books.</p>
            <p><br><b>Hint:</b> I wonder if there is some secret way to get there after clearing them out?</p>
            <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> After clearing the books, climb up the waterfall on the right side of the room. There you will find a hidden passage that takes you back through this part of the level, until you get to the crystal heart.</span></p>

          <article class="Mgolden story"><h2>Golden Ridge</h2>
            <p><br>After the resort, the golden ridge offers a much more relaxing climb. Manouver though spiky crystals and moving blocks to climb up the wonderful landscape. <br><br> At the end of the chapter, you will find Theo waiting for you at an old Gondola-ride to further climb the mountain. <br><br> Unfortunately, it seems to stall mid-way, causing Madeline to get a panic attack. Whith the help of Theo and his grandpa's breathing technique, Madeline manages to calm down and as if by magic, the gondola takes them the rest of the way up!</p>
          </article>    
          <article class="Mgolden gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
            <p><br>Although Golden Ridge is one of the calmest story-wise, gameplay-wise it introduces a lot of new gimmicks! <br><br>Starting with the <b>blue bubbles</b>: Jump into one of them and hold a direction to get a slight dash in said direction, and refresh Madeline's dash! <br><br> Then there are the <b>clouds</b>: A bit different from trampolines, the clouds give you a great jump boost if you time your jumps right! The white clouds stay, but the pink clouds disappear after one bounce, so look out! <br><br>The <b>wind</b>: Wind blows in a direction, greatly speeding up or slowing down Madeline's movement in that direction. Use this to your advantage, saving your dash for the times you have to move against it! <br><br><b>Moving blocks</b>: Black directional blocks move in a direction as soon as Madeline touches them. Some (the ones with the buttons) Can be slightly manipulated to change their trajectory. <br><br> And lastly, <b>Snowballs</b>: Together with the wind, snowballs spawn at your current height in the level and travel at that level until they either hit you, killing you, or reaching the end of the screen. That is, unless you manage to jump on them! In that case, you get a small height boost and your dash is refreshed!</p>
            <h2><br>Cassette tape (B-Side)</h2>
            <p>In the screen with wind and three blue clouds, in the top left there is a secret passage. Get over there using the wind to your advantage and continue to the left until you get to the cassette room!</p>
            <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
            <p>The crystal heart of this chapter is found at the sanctuary. After reaching the glowing area, dive under the water to get to a secret room. Dash into the right wall to get into an even more secret room!</p>
            <p><br><b>Hint:</b> That block looks out of place! Its straight from SMB 3! Can i use it to climb up to the Heart?</p>
            <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> In the game SMB 3, standing on the white block and holding crouch for a while makes you sink into the background. As a homage to SMB 3, if Madeline crouches for a while on the white block she goes into the background, and using the plattforms in the background you can easly climb up to the Crystal Heart!</span></p>

            <p><br>Welcome to the most mysterious chapter in the whole game! Startion off directly after getting out of the gondola, Madeline is creeped out by this aincient temple. Theo, instead, finds it the perfect place to get some cool selfies and runs inside. <br> Follow him in to the temple and start exploring It's non-linear structure, while seraching for Theo, and soon you will find tha namesake Mirror. <br><br> Upon activating it (ignoring warnings by Badeline of the Mountains magic), Madeline seems to have awakened some monsters, as the temple changes around her reflecting her fears and morphing into creepy hallways, tentakle-like hazards and deadly crystal spikes. <br><br> Continue navigating through this maddening temple to find theo locked in a crystal, and carry him through rooms upon rooms of monsters trying to get you to finally reach the outside. Fortunately safe, but traumatized at the least!</p>

          <article class="Mmirror gameplay"><h2>Gameplay:</h2>
            <p><br>After the Golden Ridge, Mirror temple certainly does not slow down. The Mirror temple is home to multiple new gimmicks. <br><br>Starting off with <b>Door-Switches</b>: Green blinking Switches need to be dashed into to open various closed doors, and progress the level. <br><br> <b>Dash-Blocks</b>: These special blocks move suddently when Madeline dashes. Use your dash wiseley and use the momentum the block impart to fly with great speeds. <br><br> <b>Red Bubbles</b>: Unlike their blue counterparts, these red bubbles don't know when to stop. Get in one of them to fly in a direction, only stopping when hitting a wall, a hazard or dashing out to interrupt your flight. <br><br><b>Eye-Monsters</b>: These horrible creatures roam the level once the mirror has been activated. They dash towards Madeline on-sight, killing her on contact. Their dash can break red blocks, and they can not pass the white boundries. Like the snowballs and Mr Oshiro, you can jump on them to kill them and gain back your dash. Upon death, they become a statue for a brief moment until they respawn, giving off a shockwave movin Madeline and anything else closeby! <br><br><b>Crystal Theo</b>: Theo is stuck in a crystal, and its your job to carry him to safetey! Carry him with the climb-button, and let go to throw him in a direction! Theo can be used to interrupt the monsters dashes, and to press switches! </p>
            <h2><br>Cassette tape (B-Side)</h2>
            <p>Before activating the mirror, in the main big room, get to a strawberry. Then another one to the right, and to the right again enter a secret tunnel for an even more secret room. There you will find the cassette tape.</p>
            <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
            <p>The crystal heart of this chapter is found right before using the keys after the cassette.</p>
            <p><br><b>Hint:</b> One of the spiked plattforms is not like the others... what secrets does it hold?</p>
            <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> using the red bubble to get back, interrupt your flight in the middle to find a secret red bubble going straight up. this will lead you to a secret tunnel letting you save the key and bypass the door. The key can later be used to open another door, one witch leads to the crystal heart.</span></p>

Still, a lot of new mechanics are intoduced. <br><br><b>Golden Feather</b>: The golden feather is an item that when collected turns Madeline into a golden sphere, flying with high speeds in whatever direction you are holding. The golden feathers can appear normally or in a bubble, in witch case you have to dash into them to activate them. <br><br><b>Kevin-blocks</b>: These funny-looking blocks stavel straight forward in a direction when they are dashed into.

            <h2><br>Crystal Heart</h2>
            <p>By far the most complicated challenge for a crystal heart, it can be found before the final summit climb if you crouch-dash to the right. But you need something to unlock it...</p>
            <p><br><b>Hint:</b> There are <b>six</b> jewels, and <b>six</b> section to this level... That cant be a coincidence right?</p>
            <p><br><b>Solution:</b> <span class="hidden"> You need to fine each jewel in each section to unlock the crystal heart. The jewels can be found in these locations: <br><b>The star</b>: In the first section, dont grab the last purple orb and dash to the right wall instead. Go to the right to find this jewel. <br><b>Sapphire</b>: Take a roundabout route to the left and collect the strawberries until you find a small hole in the ground in the middle of a screen. Fall down and find the room with the sapphire. <br><b>Emerald</b>: While collecting strawberries again, you may find a section with two small dream blocks with spikes on top. The wall to the right between them is damaged, and dashing into it reveals the room with the emerald. <br><b>Topaz</b>: Before going up into the snowy area, you might find that the right wooden wall in the celestial resort is damaged. Go into it to find the secret room with the topaz. <br><b>Diamond</b>: One of the most difficult ones, at the beginning of the Golden Ridge section, go to the left room and double-dash up to the left to find a hidden ledge. From that one, continue heading left and up to find a secret room with strawberries and the diamond. <br><b>Pearl</b>: Go to the left at the beginning of this section to get to a secret strawberry room.
